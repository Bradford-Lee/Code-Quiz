# Code-Quiz

## Description

The motivation for this project was to complete the challenge of building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This challenge allows us to get familiar with javascript and run in the browser. The challenge also prepares us for what the interview process may look like from an employeer. During this challenge I learned to use queryselectors, setattributes, addeventlisteners, and utilize for loops.

## Installation

Download the Code-Quiz folder which contains the html, css, and javascript files to open the webpage.

## Usage 

Someone may use this website https://bradford-lee.github.io/Code-Quiz/ if they would like to take a quiz on popular Marvel villians. To begin, click the "Start Quiz" button and a question will be presented. When you click on one of the four presented buttons, another question will appear. If you answer the question incorrectly, the timer will be decreased by 10 seconds. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game will be over and you will be able to log your initials and score. Please see the below screenshot for reference.
